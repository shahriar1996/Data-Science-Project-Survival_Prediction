## Summary of the project
This project is a combination of data cleaning, data visualization, and predictive analysis. The data visualization part for this project was taken from my [Titanic](https://github.com/shahriar1996/Titanic) project. The goal for this project is to have an experience on how build a predictive model from the beginning to the end when a set of data is given. And the model can be used in future to predict the result if some information was given. The project started by cleaning the data set and setting a visualization to understand what variables will be the most effective to create a model. After having a better understanding of the data set, the predictive model is created. The final goal is to make the model better so that the error rate goes down and it gives a better prediction when some values where given.
